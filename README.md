# MNIST-Digit.Recognizer-CNNs <Br>
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.<Br>
It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.<Br>
The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.<Br>
It can be simply imported from Keras Datasets using from keras.datasets import mnist. <Br>

- Steps to run the code<Br>
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook named as MNIST_DigitRecognition_UsingCNN.ipynb<Br>
2. Save the weight as mnist.h5<Br>
3. Using graphical user interface test the model -> Run gui.py<Br>
4. Result<Br>
Test loss: 2.1604199409484863<Br>
Test accuracy: 0.5544000267982483
